# Stop Monitoring a Stream

* If the bot is online and not responding to your commands, make sure it has `Send Messages` permission in the channel you are running the commands.

## Step 1

Stop monitoring a channel by running the following command

```

## Step 2

If you didn't enter a `[stream url]`, the bot will ask you for the link to the stream you wish to stop monitoring.
