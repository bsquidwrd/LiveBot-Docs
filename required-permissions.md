description: Below are the permissions required for the bot to fully work
---

# Required Permissions

* Send Messages
* Embed Links
  * Used to send the actual notifications
* Read Message History
  * Used for retrieving old messages the bot itself has sent
* Mention @everyone, @here, and All Roles
  * Mention the role you select during setup (if any)
* Use External Emojis

#### Note:

If the above permissions are assigned to the Bot on the Server level, but you're still having issues, please make sure to check the permissions on the channel you are setting up the bot to send notifications in AND the channel you are running the commands in (if they aren't the same channel)

If you run into any difficulties, and just want it to "work", you can try assigning "Administrator" to the role `Live Bot` for the Discord Server.
